With the launch of Amazon Pharmacy, I was curious to learn what were the general public's reaction to the entrance of the big multinational company in the OTC and generic drugs market. People usually turn to Amazon for some of their daily shopping, but what about this? Would people be willing to buy generic drugs through Amazon or would they prefer to buy them at more traditional pharmacies such as CVS or Walgreens?

The objective of this research and analysis was to get the repercusions on the launch of Amazon Pharmacy. The project intended to base itself out of tweets by connecting to the Twitter API. However, the launch was so fresh by the time I carried out this analysis, that I couldn't find many tweets. Therefore, I pivoted to webhose and looked for articles there about Amazon Pharmacy. Unfortunately, I ran across the same issue.

Lastly, what I did was to look at what did people value from direct competitors. By looking at the tweets and articles from CVS and Walgreens, and focusing on aspects such as safety, price and other important factors, I would be able to understand what would people demand from Amazon Pharmacy to that make them choose it as opposed instead of those brands.
